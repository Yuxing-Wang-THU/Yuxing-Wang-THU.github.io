<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In the era of information, the emergence of big data and artificial intelligence technologies has made the issues of data privacy more acute and complex. In the past few years, a number of new privacy issues represented by the big data based price discrimination and the privacy leakage on smart platforms have emerged, generating significant negative impacts on governments enterprises and the public. However, the information technology is updated at a pace much faster than the frequency of revision of legal regulations and the privacy issues need to be re-examined from a rational and constructive perspective. In this paper, we conduct a systematic analysis and reflection on the challenge of big data privacy and present corresponding solutions in terms of technical standards, ethics education and industrial regulations.</p>
