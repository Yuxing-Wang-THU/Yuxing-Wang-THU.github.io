However, the conventional co-design process often starts from scratch, lacking the utilization of prior knowledge. This can result in time-consuming and costly endeavors. In this paper, we present PreCo, a novel methodology that efficiently integrates brain-body pre-training into the co-design process of modular soft robots. PreCo is based on the insight of encoding co-design principles into models, achieved by pre-training a pleiotropic co-design policy on a diverse set of tasks. The pre-trained co-designer is utilized to generate initial designs and control policies and then fine-tune them for a specific co-design task. Through experiments on a modular soft robot system, our method demonstrates zero-shot generalization to unseen co-design tasks and enables rapid adaptation with significantly reduced policy iterations.</p> <p>ðŸ“‚ <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=E2vL12SwO1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Download paper here!</a><br></p> <p><strong>Bibtex</strong><br></p> <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>@inproceedings<span class="o">{</span>
